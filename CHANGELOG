Version 2.0
-----------

* The template-file, target-file, and target-executable options are deprecated in favor a single jobs option. All jobs definitions and the current one are available in the template context.
* The base-dir option is deprecated in favor of a root option. The root path is applied to both the template engine and the target files.
* Added a filters option, making it possible to load custom template filter libraries.
* All necessary subdirectories are created for the target files. Thanks to brodul for the patch.
* All parts in buildout.cfg are available to the templates, instead of being limited to the parts listed in buildout:parts. Thanks to brodul for the patch.
