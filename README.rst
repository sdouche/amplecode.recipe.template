amplecode.recipe.template
=========================

amplecode.recipe.template is a Buildout recipe for generating files using Jinja2 templates. The recipe configures a Jinja2 environment, by default relative to the Buildout directory, allowing templates to extend and include other templates relative to the environment.

Downloads are available from pypi: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/amplecode.recipe.template/

Buildout Options
================

* template-file (required): One or more Jinja2 template file paths.
* target-file (required): One of more target file paths. The number of files must match the number of template files.
* base-dir: Base directory of the Jinja2 environment. Template file paths are relative to this directory. Default is the Buildout directory.
* target-executable: One or more boolean flags (yes|no|true|false|1|0) indicating the executability of the target files. If only one flag is given it is applied to all target files.
* eggs: Reserved for a list of eggs, conveniently converted into a pkg_resources.WorkingSet when specified.

Additional options are simply forwarded to the templates, and options from all the other parts are made available through ``parts.<part-name>.<option-name>`` and ``parts[<part-name>][<option-name>]``.

Lists of Values
===============

It is possible for a recipe option to contain one or more values, separated by whitespace. A split filter is available for when you want to iterate over the whitespace separated values in your Jinja2 template::

  #!/bin/sh
  {% for cmd in cmds|split %}
     echo "{{ cmd }}"
  {% endfor %}

Minimal Example
===============

foo.txt is created from foo.txt.jinja2 without any extra options::

  [buildout]
  parts = foo

  [foo]
  recipe = amplecode.recipe.template
  template-file = foo.txt.jinja2
  target-file = foo.txt

Larger Example
==============

foo.txt is created from myapp/foo.txt.jinja2, bar.sh is created from myapp/bar.sh.jinja2, the second will be executable, and both templates can utilize the additional options specified::

  [buildout]
  parts = foo

  [foo]
  recipe = amplecode.recipe.template
  base-dir = myapp
  template-file =
      foo.txt.jinja2
      bar.sh.jinja2
  target-file =
      foo.txt
      bar.sh
  target-executable =
      false
      true
